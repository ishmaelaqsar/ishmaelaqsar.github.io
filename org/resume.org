** Flow Traders
*** Software Engineer
/September 2019 - June 2023 | Amsterdam, NL/

- Engaged in the development of an experimental pricing engine for the currency desk, leveraging zero allocation techniques to achieve minimal garbage collection impact. This approach slashed tail latencies by 80% compared to the incumbent solution, enhancing overall performance and pricing quality
- Built a new highly-available service that allowed Quants to store trained models, and for Traders to retrieve these models for pricing purposes. This solution alleviated strain on database servers, mitigating the burden of thousands of concurrent requests previously experienced each morning from individual clients
- Collaborated with JP Morgan on implementing a real-time automated Trade Reporter to onboard them as a Prime Broker. This initiative expanded the FX desk's trading reach by granting access to additional counterparties, subsequently boosting overall trading volumes
- Developed and validated Dropcopy clients for the FX desk to establish FIX based connections with new trading sessions. Facilitated trade reconciliation and met Risk Management standards, resulting in heightened trading volumes
- Implemented a high-throughput, low-latency service tailored for the FX desk. This service used Aeron for hot path communication and gRPC for configuration changes. Its implementation facilitated a reduction in hardware footprint by efficiently multiplexing sessions to trading engines, streamlining the onboarding process for new sessions, and enhancing overall operational efficiency
- Collaborated with the FX desk to integrate a Last Look strategy into their trading engine. This elevated trade quality by providing visibility into market movements prior to the acceptance or rejection of trade intentions, thereby optimising decision-making processes and refining trading outcomes

** Bet365
